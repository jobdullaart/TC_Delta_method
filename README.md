Three python files are provided:
1. tracking: this script was used to track tropical cyclones in the RACMO climate simulations: REF, TP2, and PGW
2. manuscript_figures: this script was used to analyse the climate data and create the figures of the manuscript (Figures 1 until 4). It also includes the preperation of the climate data such that it can serve as input for the hydrodynamic global tide and surge model (GTSM).
3. gtsm_figures: this last python script includes the code to make figures of GTSM output and corresponds to Figure 5 of the manuscript.
